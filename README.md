# [McKinsey Prohack Competition](https://prohack.org/)

## Setup python project

First clone the project

    > git clone git@github.com:omariyassine/ProHack.git

We're using the Pipenv as an environment manager for our development workflow. 

    > pip install pipenv

If you're on macOs and you prefer brew :

    > brew install pipenv

To setup the environment and the dependencies:

    > pipenv install --dev

The `--dev` flag is important to install the developement requirements
